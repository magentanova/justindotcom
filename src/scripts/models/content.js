Designed as a mobile game and ported onto the iOS platform using Cordova, Bloq recently finished its first round of beta testing. To minimize the code base, I used no libraries; it was especially fun for me to create my own event system, state manager, and promise-based animations.",

Today's world is highly interdisciplinary, and I'm grateful that my own path has allowed me to combine disparate skills to address gaps I've been uniquely suited to fill. I've combined my expertise in written language with an education in computer science to make strides in natural language processing, or computational linguistics. I've combined my experience as a teacher with my programming skills to place scores of new developers in software engineering jobs as the leader of an immersive course at a code boot camp.",

This page, made with React, is <a href='https://github.com/magentanova/justindotcom'>probably overengineered</a>, but I wanted an excuse to try out push-state routing with React views.",
